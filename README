This is Lua 5.1.5, adapted to use 32-bit bytecode even on 64-bit machines.

Thanks to:
- https://github.com/c0i/lua32 (basically the same thing for Lua 5.3.4)
- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39945499 (seems easier but ultimately not viable due to 32-bit architecture being deprecated on macOS)
